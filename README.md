**0x1D C - Binary tree**
<hr><br>
This repository will contain a series of tasks on DAS (Data Structure Algorithm) binary trees

<b>Learning  Objectives</b>
- What is a binary tree
- What is the difference between a binary tree and a Binary Search Tree
- What is the possible gain in terms of time complexity compared to linked lists
- What are the depth, the height, the size of a binary tree
- What are the different traversal methods to go through a binary tree
- What is a complete, a full, a perfect, a balanced binary tree
